          <p>We believe what we believe, and we will all win together.</p>
          <p>
            We want to build a system that relies not on new buyers coming in to
            keep token prices rising but on a self-sufficient system
          </p>
          <p>
            that continuously creates reflections regardless of new
            buyers/sellers also; it will be hyper deflationary.

            <span
              >Most reflection coins rely on new users to pay out old users,
              which is basically how Ponzi schemes work, especially with high
              tax tokens like +10% per transaction, which means a trader needs a
              +20% move to break even, which is CRAZY. Hence nobody trades, and
              the coin dies when the new user flow slows down and reflections
              become nonexistent.

            Here is an example where you can see BabyDoge, which has a 10%
            transaction tax and has a whopping 4,8 million $ volume, yet only
            20$ of that volume is happening on pancake swap DEX where it is
            creating reflections. So that means there is only 2$ worth of
            reflections being created by trading:

            What a absolute joke! What are the 1,6 million holders of babydoge
            going to do splitting 2$ worth of reflections for one day? yes there
            is a little more with transactions between CEXs but honestly not
            much more.

        <h3>At DeezCatz, there is a better way.</h3>
        <p>
          We want to change the way things are done; we want to create a system
          that doesn't rely on new users to keep funding the older users.
        </p>
        <p>
          But rather a system that harnesses the constant movement of trade to
          fund a treasury.
        </p>
        <p>
          The funds from said treasury are to be invested in reliable Defi
          products, creating revenue that will be deployed to increase the price
          difference of the DEEZCATZ token on two DEXs, to maximize transaction
          volume and reflections to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be using two DEXs because we will buy on one and sell on the
          other to create a price difference, wash trading repeatedly until most
          of those Defi profits have been used up to enhance that price
          difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buying on one and selling on the other will create a price difference
          that will incentivize users to trade to correct that difference we
          made (arbitrage trading).
        </p>
        <p>
          If Defi investments make X return, and we use X to generate a price
          difference, users will use another X worth of volume to fix that price
          difference and make a small profit. By doing so, we will have
          generated 2X worth of volume for DEEZCATZ, which means more
          reflections for everyone and reinvestment back into the treasury,
          which will be ever-growing and generating more significant amounts of
          X to repeat the cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is to induce more volume with the Defi rewards and
          sustainable volume to continue the cycle of funding the treasury with
          trading taxes, and increase reflections to all users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine if everyone loses interest in DeezCatz token and they stop
          trading it, your normal shitcoin would die in this scenario. But at
          DEEZCATZ the treasury will always be there using its profits from defi
          buying DEEZCATZ and selling it on the other exchange, creating that
          price difference for someone to come and take advantage with arbitrage
          trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as long as this system keeps going, there will always be trade on
          DEEZCATZ, and the treasury will keep growing, inducing more volume and
          keeping reflections alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we will burn a little bit of supply as well so the token
          supply will decrease over time as burnt supply gets token reflection
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a second to imagine what happens with an ever-growing treasury
          that buys DEEZCATZ with profits and an ever-decreasing supply, given
          enough time that maths should result in increasing token prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system will work like a flywheel, accelerating and amplifying the
          value of the tokens over time. We want to create the ultimate Hodl
          token.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >(disclaimer, this is experimental, no one or nothing can promise
            token prices will rise, its just our theory that it will do so and
            we are creating this project to test it out)</em

          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <div class="yfld">
            <p>
              DEEZCATZ will use a basic reflection model of 1.90% on buys or
              sells.
            </p>
            <p>
              ⦁ 0.70% reflections to hodlers
              <br />
              ⦁ 0.20% to liquidity on Uniswap V3
              <br />
              ⦁ 1% to treasury/marketing/liquidty on other DEXs
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that the majority of funds should flow back to hodlers
              and the treasury, the 1% will be initially broken down like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              ⦁ 0.20% to Curve liquidity
              <br />
              ⦁ 0.70% to treasury investments
              <br />
              ⦁ 0.10% for team/marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="yflxx">
              <em>(Curve is the second biggest dex on ETH)</em>
            </p>
            <p class="yflx">
              The reason for lumping treasury/Curve-liquidity/marketing/team in
              1% instead of splitting it up is to have some flexibility in the
              future if need be.

          <h3>Treasury Operations:</h3>
          <p>We will initially use 2 DEXs:</p>
          <p>
            ⦁ Uniswap V3 (biggest dex on ETH)
            <br />
            ⦁ Curve (2nd biggest dex on ETH)
          </p>
          <p>
            We will initially invest the treasury on both Uniswap V3 and Curve
            pools; returns at the time of writing this are between 20-40% per
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            these returns will be sold into ETH and then traded to DEEZCATZ on
            the DEX with the highest price at that moment of trade.
          </p>
          <p>⦁ Then sold on the dex with lowest price.</p>
          <p>⦁ Then rebought on dex with highest price</p>

            The point of this process, as stated above, will be to increase the
            price difference, which will attract other arbitrage traders or
            community members to do the opposite of what the treasury is doing
            to gain money on the price difference created by the treasury.
            Essentially, the treasury creates a bunch of volume with this
            manoeuvre, and users then come and create more volume to rectify
            what treasury did with its price difference.All this volume is what
            a reflection token needs. More volume = more reflections, which is
            the lifeblood of a reflection model token, also this should create
            sustainable unstoppable trading volume.

        The majority of the sales funds will go to the treasury to be invested
        in DeFi since that will be the life blood of this project, to enhance
        the volume potential, we will have a relatively smaller liquidity pool
        to start with, the reasoning behind that is the treasury will start
        small so it will have a greater effect on two small liquidity pools.

        <h3>Whats the point of all this?</h3>
        <p>
          Why invest in DEEZCATZ? You would be cutting out a lot of middleman
          risk. But here at DEEZCATZ, we believe the concept of reflection
          tokens has massive potential, which we have yet to harness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think of it very simply, the passive investment in defi will
          continuously be increasing which will increase the value of DEEZCATZ
          and will also increase volumes, due to the wash trading mechanics
          stated earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          token hodlers wallets are increasing while the total supply of
          DEEZCATZ is decreasing because of the 10% burnt also getting
          reflections.
